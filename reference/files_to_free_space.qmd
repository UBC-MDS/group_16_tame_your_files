files_to_free_space(root, target_bytes)
```

Determine the minimum number of files that would need to be deleted
to free at least a given amount of disk space.

| root         | Path   | Root directory to scan.                    | _required_ |
| target_bytes | int    | Desired amount of space to free, in bytes. | _required_ |

## Returns {.doc-section .doc-section-returns}

| Name   | Type             | Description                                                                                                                           |

|        | list\[FileInfo\] | A list of files whose combined size is greater than or equal to target_bytes. Files are selected greedily, starting from the largest. |

## Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

- Files are selected by descending size.
- Selection stops as soon as the target is met.
- If target_bytes <= 0, an empty list is returned.
- If total file size is insufficient, all files are returned.
- No files are deleted.

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
>>> import tempfile
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
...     root = Path(tmp)
...     _ = (root / "a.txt").write_text("a")
...     _ = (root / "b.txt").write_text("bbb")
...     [item.path.name for item in files_to_free_space(root, 2)]
['b.txt']
